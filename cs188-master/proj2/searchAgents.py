"""
This file contains all of the agents that can be selected to control Pacman.  To
select an agent, use the '-p' option when running pacman.py.  Arguments can be
passed to your agent using '-a'.  For example, to load a SearchAgent that uses
depth first search (dfs), run the following command:

> python pacman.py -p SearchAgent -a fn=aStarSearch

Commands to invoke other search strategies can be found in the project
description.

Please only change the parts of the file you are asked to.  Look for the lines
that say

"*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

The parts you fill in start about 3/4 of the way down.  Follow the project
description for details.

Good luck and happy searching!
